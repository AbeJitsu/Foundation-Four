# Git Safety: Never commit secrets or build artifacts
# This file tells Git which files to ignore. Think of it as a bouncer at the door,
# making sure sensitive files and temporary build files never make it into version control.
#
# Two main categories we're protecting:
# 1. SECRETS - Environment variables, API keys, database passwords (never share these!)
# 2. BUILD ARTIFACTS - Generated files that can be recreated (they bloat the repo)

# Environment variables - each developer has their own secrets
.env
.env.local
.env.*.local

# Next.js build outputs
.next/
out/
build/

# Node modules - install fresh from package.json on each machine
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
pnpm-debug.log*

# IDE and editor files - keep personal editor preferences local
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo
*~
.DS_Store
.prettierignore

# OS generated files
Thumbs.db
.env.prod
.env.prod.local

# Docker volumes and local data (these shouldn't be in git)

# TypeScript compiled output
*.tsbuildinfo

# Test coverage reports

# Temporary files
